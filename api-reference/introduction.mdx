## Important Data Formats

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pricing Format (Products/Quotations)" icon="euro-sign">
    When creating events with products for draft quotations, prices and VAT must use specific formats:

    **Prices (`price_without_tax`)**:
    - Provided in **cents/centimes**, not euros/dollars
    - Example: €150.00 = `150000` cents
    - Example: €35.50 = `3550` cents

    **VAT (`vat`)**:
    - Provided in **basis points** (1/100th of a percent), not percentages
    - Example: 20% VAT = `2000` basis points
    - Example: 10% VAT = `1000` basis points
    - Example: 5.5% VAT = `550` basis points
    - Valid range: `0` to `10000` (0% to 100%)

    **Why this format?**
    This ensures precision for financial calculations and avoids floating-point rounding errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Date and Time Format" icon="calendar">
    All dates and times must follow specific formats:

    **Dates**:
    - Format: `DD-MM-YYYY`
    - Example: `"15-03-2025"` for March 15, 2025

    **Times**:
    - Format: `HH:mm` (24-hour format)
    - Example: `"14:30"` for 2:30 PM
    - Example: `"09:00"` for 9:00 AM
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

The BookingShake API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and service quality:

- **POST /events/create**: 10 requests per minute
- **GET endpoints** (sources, spaces, status, fields): 60 requests per minute

Rate limit information is provided in response headers. See the [Rate Limiting Guide](/api-reference/rate-limiting) for details.

## API Stability

The BookingShake API is production-ready and actively maintained. We're committed to backward compatibility and will announce any breaking changes well in advance.
