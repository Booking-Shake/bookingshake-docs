## Overview

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications when data changes in BookingShake. Instead of polling the API for updates, BookingShake automatically sends HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint whenever an account or contact is created, updated, or deleted.

**Why use webhooks?**
- **Real-time updates**: Receive notifications instantly when data changes
- **Reduced API usage**: No need to continuously poll for changes
- **Efficient**: Only get notified about events you care about
- **Scalable**: Build reactive integrations that sync data automatically

**Common use cases:**
- Sync contacts and accounts to external CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Trigger automated workflows when new contacts are created
- Update analytics dashboards in real-time
- Maintain data consistency across multiple platforms

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Webhook Settings">
    In your BookingShake dashboard, go to **Settings > Integrations** and scroll to the **Webhooks** section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Webhook">
    Click **New Webhook** and configure:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your webhook (e.g., "CRM Sync")
    - **URL**: Your HTTPS endpoint (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/webhooks/bookingshake`)
    - **Events**: Select which events to receive (see available events below)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Copy Secret">
    After saving, copy the webhook secret. You'll need it to verify webhook signatures for security.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Webhook">
    Create or update a contact or account to trigger a test webhook delivery.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Events

## HTTP Headers

Each webhook request includes these headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Bookingshake-Webhooks/1.0
Bookingshake-Signature: <hmac-sha256-signature>
Idempotency-Key: <unique-uuid>
```

### Header Details

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | Always `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | Identifies the request as coming from BookingShake webhooks |
| `Bookingshake-Signature` | HMAC SHA256 signature for verifying authenticity (see [Security](/api-reference/webhooks/security)) |
| `Idempotency-Key` | Unique UUID for this delivery attempt - use to prevent duplicate processing |

## Custom Fields

Webhooks include custom fields configured for your venue. Custom fields are prefixed with `custom_` followed by a UUID:

```json
{
  "event": "contact.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "contact-456",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "custom_5d07ff93-9b23-4e37-8654-4661fcfd8da8": "VIP Customer",
    "custom_7a12bc34-5de6-4f78-9012-3456789abcde": [0, 1, 2]
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Custom field values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or objects depending on your field configuration.
</Note>

## Venue vs Venues Group Webhooks

When creating a webhook, you can choose the scope:

**Venue-level webhooks**: Receive events only for a specific venue
- Use when you want separate webhook endpoints per venue
- Useful for venue-specific integrations

**Venues group webhooks**: Receive events for all venues in a group
- Use when you want a single endpoint for multiple venues
- More efficient for managing multi-venue organizations
- The `venue_id` field identifies which venue triggered the event

## Rate Limits and Delivery

<Note>
  **Delivery timeout**: Your endpoint must respond within 5 seconds with a `200-299` status code.

  **Retry policy**: Failed deliveries are automatically retried up to 10 times with exponential backoff.

  **Status monitoring**: Check your webhook status in the dashboard to track delivery success and failures.
